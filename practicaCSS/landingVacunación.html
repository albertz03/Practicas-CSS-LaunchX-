          <h2>Plagueis Tragedy</h2>
          <p>
            Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought
            not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.
            Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise
            he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create
            life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even
            keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force
            is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He
            became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his
            power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught
            his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in
            his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
